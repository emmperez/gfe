/* 
    Debouncing is a technique used to control how many times we allow a 
    function to be executed over time. When a JavaScript function is debounced 
    with a wait time of X milliseconds, it must wait until after X milliseconds 
    have elapsed since the debounced function was last called. You almost 
    certainly have encountered debouncing in your daily lives before â€” when entering 
    an elevator. Only after X duration of not pressing the "Door open" button 
    (the debounced function not being called) will the elevator door actually close 
    (the callback function is executed).

    Implement a debounce function which accepts a callback function and a wait duration. 
    Calling debounce() returns a function which has debounced invocations of the callback 
    function following the behavior described above. 
*/

/*
    Solution: Given that there's a wait duration before the function can be invoked, 
    we know that we will need a timer, and setTimeout is the first thing that comes to mind.
    
    We will also need to return a function which wraps around the callback function parameter. 
    This function needs to do a few things:

    1. Debounce invocation
      - It invokes the callback function only after a delay of wait. This is performed using 
        setTimeout. Since we might need to clear the timer if the debounced function is called 
        again while there's a pending invocation, we need to retain a reference to a timeoutID, 
        which is the returned value of setTimeout.
      - If the function is called again while there's a pending invocation, we should cancel 
        existing timers and schedule a new timer for the delayed invocation with the full wait 
        duration. We can cancel the timer via clearTimeout(timeoutID).
    2. Calls the callback function with the right parameters
      - Debounced functions are used like the original functions, so we should forward the value 
        of this and function arguments when invoking the original callback functions.

      - You may be tempted to use func(...args) but this will be lost if callback functions 
        are invoked that way. Hence we have use Function.prototype.apply()/Function.prototype.call() 
        which allows us to specify this as the first argument.

        func.apply(thisArg, args)
        func.call(thisArg, ...args)

    Edge Cases: 
    The main pitfall in this question is invoking the callback function with the correct this, 
    the value of this when the debounced function was called. Since the callback function will 
    be invoked in a timeout, we need to ensure that the first argument to func.apply()/func.call() 
    is the right value. There are two ways to achieve this:

    - Use another variable to keep a reference to this and access this via that variable from 
      within the setTimeout callback. This is the traditional way of preserving this before 
      arrow functions existed.
    - Use an arrow function to declare the setTimeout callback where the this value within 
      it has lexical scope. The value of this within arrow functions is bound to the context 
      in which the function is created, not to the environment in which the function is called.
*/

export default function debounce(func, wait = 0) {
    let timeoutID = null;
    return function (...args) {
      // Keep a reference to `this` so that
      // func.apply() can access it.
      const context = this;
      clearTimeout(timeoutID);
  
      timeoutID = setTimeout(function () {
        timeoutID = null; // Not strictly necessary but good to do this.
        func.apply(context, args);
      }, wait);
    };
}

/* 
  Practical Example:
  Imagine a search bar where you fetch results as the user types. Without debounce, you might 
  send too many API requests. With debounce:
*/

const search = debounce((query) => {
  console.log("Searching for:", query);
}, 500);

// Simulating user typing:
search("H"); // Timer starts
search("He"); // Old timer cleared, new timer starts
search("Hel"); // Old timer cleared, new timer starts
search("Hell"); // Old timer cleared, new timer starts
search("Hello"); // Old timer cleared, new timer starts

// After 500ms of no typing, "Searching for: Hello" logs
